## 2022

- [机器学习 专项课程 v2](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)
  - 2022-06-16
  - 一般般, 不推荐.
  - 相较于之前的版本:
  - 弱化了算法的介绍, 只挑选不同类型下最基本的介绍;
  - 强化了工程方法, 或者通用的实践流程.
  - https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
  - https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/THGATFHMCZ8T

- __未来, 期待 Coursera 能有一些优质的量子计算的课程__

- [Cryptography II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto2)
  - 跳票 几年了 ~
  - 授课大神 Dan Boneh 也研究 区块链 了 :)
  - _BLS Signatures_
  - 不抱期望了, ByeBye, Coursera

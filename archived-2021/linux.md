  - Learn Makefile with the tastiest examples

### Observability

* `uptime`
  - `cat /proc/loadavg`
* `sudo dmesg --human | less`
  - Think of it as kernel and driver logs.
* `df -h`
  - capacity
* `iostat -x`
  - throughput
  - `sudo apt-get install sysstat`
* `sudo biotop-bpfcc`
  - `sudo apt-get install bpfcc-tools linux-headers-$(uname -r)`
  - https://github.com/iovisor/bcc
* `sar -n DEV 1 1`
* `sar -n EDEV 1 1`
* `sar -n TCP,ETCP 1 1`
  - `/etc/default/sysstat`, `ENABLED="true"`
  - `sudo service sysstat restart`
* `sudo tcptop-bpfcc 1 1`
* `free -h`
  - `df` for RAM
  - https://www.linuxatemyram.com
  - If the `available` column is showing a
    reasonable amount left, you're all right.
* `top`
  - `?`
* `vmstat -s`
* `sudo oomkill-bpfcc`
* `mpstat -P ALL 1`
  - `cat /proc/cpuinfo`
* `sudo opensnoop-bpfcc`
* `sudo execsnoop-bpfcc`

### Memory

* The **OOM Killer** is one of the more interesting (and controversial)
  memory management features in the Linux kernel.
  - Under low-memory conditions, the **OOM Killer** kicks in and
    tries to figure out which processes to kill in order to
    reclaim some memory and for the system to regain some stability.
  - It uses heuristics (including niceness, how recent the process is
    and how much memory it uses) to score each process
    and pick the unlucky winner.
  - The **OOM Killer** behavior can be tweaked
    via flags exposed by the kernel.

# -v, --verbose
#   Make the operation more talkative
# -k, --insecure
#   Allow insecure server connections when using SSL

curl -H "Host: dashboard.awx.im" \

Think of eBPF as making the operating system programmable
in the same way as JavaScript and other languages
have done this to the web browser.
We are therefore looking into an exciting future of innovation ahead of us.

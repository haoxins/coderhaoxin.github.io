Gilbert Strang, an MIT mathematics professor,
received a standing ovation after giving his
last linear algebra lecture on Monday.

After 63 years teaching and over 10 million
views on his online lectures, MIT professor
Gilbert Strang received a standing ovation
from his students Monday once he completed
his last linear algebra lecture.

The mathematics professor graduated from MIT
in 1955 and has since published several books
on linear algebra and differential equations.
He was one of the first professors to publish
his lectures on the institute's online
open learning library OpenCourseWare, or OCW,
and continues to fall within the top 10
most viewed lecturers at MIT.

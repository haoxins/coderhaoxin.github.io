```
Assuming that you can avoid undefined behavior in C and C++
is like assuming you can win a game of chess
simply because you know the rules.

The Rust language makes you a simple promise:
if your program passes the compiler's checks,
it is free of undefined behavior.

Further, Rust aims to be both safe and pleasant to use.
In order to make stronger guarantees about your program's behavior,
Rust imposes more restrictions on your code than C and C++ do,
and these restrictions take practice and experience to get used to.

## Tour

* **`assert!`**
  - Rust always checks assertions

* use **`return`** statements only for explicit early returns from the mids of a function

* **`#[test]`**
  - attribute: open-ended

* A `trait` must be in scope in order to use its methods

* Rust does not have exceptions:
  - all errors are handled using either `Result` or `panic`

* **All** Rust functions are **thread-safe**
  - Really?

* Rust lets you simply write `Complex { re, im }`.
  - This is modeled on similar notations in JavaScript.

* This kind of match statement is such a common pattern in Rust
  that the language provides the **`?`** operator
  as shorthand for the whole thing.

## Concepts

* Rust uses the `u8` type for byte values

* Rust's `character` type `char` represents
  a single `Unicode` character, as a `32-bit` value.

* Rust uses the `char` type for single characters in isolation,
  but uses the `UTF-8` encoding for `strings` and `streams` of text.
  So, a String represents its text as a sequence of `UTF-8` bytes,
  not as an array of characters.

* To a certain extent, tuples resemble arrays:
  - both types represent an ordered sequence of values.
  - each element of a tuple can have a different type,
    whereas an array's elements must be all the same type.
  - tuples allow only constants as indices,
    like `t.4`. You can't write `t.i` or `t[i]`.

* Pointer types
  - References
  - Boxes (heap)
  - Unsafe pointers/Raw pointers

* Rust references are never null
  - `&T`
  - `&mut T`

* Array: `[T; N]`
* Vector: `Vec<T>`
  - `vec![1, 2, 3]`
* Shared slice: `&[T]`
* Mutable slice: `&mut [T]`

> Share or Modify

* Strings (**`str`**)
  - String literals
  - Raw strings
  - Byte stings

## Basics

* Ownership tree
  - **Copy types**: excused from the ownership rules
  - You can move values from one owner to another
  - **Rc, Arc** reference-counted pointer types
  - Borrow a reference, references are non-owning pointers

> In Rust, for most types, Rust doesn't copy the value but moves it.

* The standard Copy types include all the machine integer
  and floating-point numeric types, the char and bool types,
  and a few others. A tuple or fixed-size array of
  Copy types is itself a Copy type.

* A value owned by an `Rc` pointer is immutable.

* References: non-owning
  - must never outlive their referents

* A *shared reference* lets you read but not modify its referent
  - *Shared references* are *Copy*
* If you have a *mutable reference* to a value,
  you may both read and modify the value
  - *Mutable references* are not *Copy*
* A *multiple readers and single writer* rule

* The **.** operator implicitly dereferences its left operand if needed.
* The **.** operator can also implicitly borrow a reference
  to its left operand if needed for a method call.

* The **.** operator follows as many references
  as it takes to find its target.

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
let p = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
let r: &Point = &p;
let rr: &&Point = &r;
let rrr: &&&Point = &rr;
assert_eq!(rrr.x, 1);
assert_eq!(rrr.y, 2);
```

* Like the **.** operator, Rust's comparison operators
  "see-through" any number of references.

```rust
let x = 1;
let y = 1;
let rx = &x;
let ry = &y;
let rrx = &rx;
let rry = &ry;
assert!(rrx <= rry);
assert!(rrx == rry);
assert!(rrx >= rry);
```

* In Rust, a function's signature always exposes the body's behavior.

* Whenever a reference type appears inside another
  type's definition, you must write out its lifetime.

* If your function is a method on some type and
  takes its **self** parameter by reference,
  then that breaks the tie: Rust assumes that
  *self*'s lifetime is the one to give
  everything in your return value.

* Rust assumes that whatever you're borrowing,
  you're borrowing from *self*.

* Note that in both cases, the path of ownership
  leading to the referent cannot be changed for
  the reference's lifetime.
  For a shared borrow, the path is *read-only*;
  for a mutable borrow, it's completely in accessible.
  So there's no way for the program to do anything
  that will invalidate the reference.

* Most of the *control flow* tools in C are statements.
  In Rust, they are ***all expressions***.

* It's never strictly necessary to use `if let`,
  because `match` can do everything `if let` can do.
  An `if let` express on is shorthand for
  a `match` with just one pattern.

* The `..=` operator produces end-inclusive (or closed) ranges,
  which do include the end value.
  For example, the range `..= 3`
  includes the numbers `0, 1, 2,` and `3`.

* As in *C*, `a % b` computes the signed remainder,
  or modulus, of division rounding toward zero.
  The result has the same sign as the lefthand operand.
  Note that `%` can be used on
  floating-point numbers as well as integers:

```rust
let x = 1234.567 % 10.0; // approximately 4.567
```

* However, what we did earlier is generally considered
  the best style import `types`, `traits`, and `modules`
  (like `std::mem`)
  and then use relative paths to access the
  `functions`, `constants`, and other `members` within.

* Modules do not automatically inherit
  names from their parent modules.

* A **`constant`** is a bit like a *C++* **`#define`**:
  - the value is compiled into your code every place it's used.
* A **`static`** is a variable that's set up before
  your program starts running and lasts until it exits.
* Use **`constants`** for *magic numbers* and `strings` in your code.
* Use **`statics`** for *larger amounts of data*,
  or any time you need to *borrow* a *reference* to the constant value.

* The code in **`src/lib.rs`** forms the root module of the library.
  - Other crates that use our library can only access
    the public items of this root module.

* The **`src/bin`** Directory
  - Cargo has some built-in support for small
    programs that live in the same crate as a library.

* To attach an attribute to a whole crate,
  add it at the top of the `main.rs` or `lib.rs` file,
  before any items, and write **`#!`** instead of **`#`**.

* ***Integration tests*** are `.rs` files that live in a **`tests`**
  directory alongside your project's **`src`** directory.
  When you run `cargo test`, Cargo compiles each integration test
  as a separate, standalone crate, linked with your
  library and the Rust test harness.

* ***Integration tests*** are valuable in part because
  they see your crate from the *outside*, just as a user would.
  They test the crate's **public** API.

* `cargo test` runs both *unit tests* and *integration tests*.

* **`panic`** is per thread

* **Errors**
  - *Printing Errors*
  - *Propagating Errors*, *`Option.?`*, *`Result.?`*
  - *Ignoring Errors*, `let _ = writeln!(stderr(), "error: {}", err);`
  - *Custom Error Type*

* **Why Results?**
  - The most common decision is to allow errors to *propagate*,
    and that's written with a single character, **`?`**.
    Thus, error plumbing does not clutter up
    your code the way it does in *C* and *Go*.
  - Since the possibility of errors is part of every function's *return type*,
    it's clear which functions can fail and which cant.
    If you change a function to be fallible,
    you're changing its return type,
    so the compiler will make you update that functions downstream users.
  - Rust checks that *Result* values are used,
    so you can't accidentally let an error pass silently
    (a common mistake in C).
  - Since *Result* is a data type like any other,
    it's easy to store success and error results in the same collection.
    This makes it easy to model partial success.

* `#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]`

* **Interior Mutability**
  - *`Cell<T>`*
  - *`RefCell<T>`*

### Enums and Patterns

* **Enum**
  - *unit-like* structs
  - *tuple variants*, tuple structs
  - *struct variants*

* *expressions* produce values; *patterns* consume values

## Traits & Generics

* The type of *`out`* is **`&mut dyn Write`**, meaning
  *"a mutable reference to any value that implements the Write trait"*

* Generics and traits are closely related:
  - *generic* functions use *traits* in bounds to spell out
    what types of arguments they can be applied to.
  - So we'll also talk about how *`&mut dyn Write`*
    and *`<T: Write>`* are *similar*, how they're *different*,
    and how to choose between these two ways of using *traits*.

* There is one unusual rule about trait methods:
  **the trait itself must be in scope**.
  Otherwise, all its methods are hidden.

* Rust lets you implement *any trait* on *any type*,
  as long as either the trait or the type is
  introduced in the current crate.
* This means that any time you want to add a method
  to any type, you can use a trait to do it.
  - *extension trait*

* In Rust, a *subtrait* does not inherit the
  associated items of its *supertrait*; each
  trait still needs to be in scope if you want to
  call its methods.
* In fact, Rust's *subtraits* are really just a
  shorthand for a bound on `Self`.

* **Type-Associated Functions**
* In most object-oriented languages, *interfaces*
  can't include *static methods* or *constructors*,
  but traits can include *type-associated functions*,
  Rust's analog to *static methods*.

* In Rust, the expression `lhs * rhs` is shorthand
  for `Mul::mul(lhs, rhs)`. So overloading the `*`
  operator in Rust is as simple as
  implementing the `Mul` trait.

* There is one important exception. Using generics
  allows callers of the function to specify the
  type of the generic argument `s`, like
  `print::<i32>(42)`, while
  using `impl Trait` does not.

* Each `impl Trait` argument is assigned its own
  anonymous type parameter, so `impl Trait` for
  arguments is limited to only the simplest
  generic functions, with no relationships
  between the types of arguments.

# CPU: The parallel workhorse

## Vectorization: FLOPs for free

* In the SIMD case, as the name indicates, there is
  a single instruction that is executed across
  multiple data streams.
  - One vector add instruction replaces eight individual
    scalar add instructions in the instruction queue,
    which reduces the pressure on the instruction
    queue and cache.
  - The biggest benefit is that it takes about the same
    power to perform eight additions in a vector unit
    as one scalar addition.

* Let's briefly summarize **vectorization** terminology:
  - **Vector (SIMD) lane**:
  - A pathway through a vector operation on vector
    registers for a single data element much like
    a lane on a multi-lane freeway.
  - **Vector width**
  - The width of the vector unit, usually expressed in bits.
  - **Vector length**
  - The number of data elements that can be processed
    by the vector in one operation.
  - **Vector (SIMD) instruction sets**
  - The set of instructions that extend the regular
    scalar processor instructions to utilize
    the vector processor.
* **Vectorization** is produced through both a software
  and a hardware component. The requirements are:
  - **Generate instructions**
  - The vector instructions must be generated by the
    compiler or manually specified through
    intrinsics or assembler coding.
  - **Match instructions to the vector unit of the processor**
  - If there is a mismatch between the instructions and the
    hardware, newer hardware can usually process the
    instructions, but older hardware will just fail to run.

> - When you use the latest processors, make sure to use
    the latest versions of the compiler.

* The **vector hardware releases** over the last decade
  have dramatically improved vector functionality.
  - `SSE` (Streaming SIMD Extensions)
  - `SSE2` (From `2001`)
  - `AVX` (Advanced Vector Extensions)
  - `AVX2`
  - `AVX512`
* From the years `2018` and on, **Intel** and **AMD**
  have created multiple variants of `AVX512` as
  incremental improvements to
  **vector hardware architectures**.
* There are several ways to achieve vectorization
  in your program. In ascending order of
  programmer effort, these include:
  - Optimized libraries
  - Auto-vectorization
  - Hints to the compiler
  - Vector intrinsics
  - Assembler instructions

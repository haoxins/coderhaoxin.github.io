## Closures

* The only thing we've changed is to add the
  `move` keyword before each of the two closures.
  The `move` keyword tells Rust that a closure
  doesn't *borrow* the variables it uses:
  - it *steals* them.
* Rust thus offers two ways for closures to get
  data from enclosing scopes:
  - **moves** and **borrowing**.
* Really there is nothing more to say than that;
  closures follow the same rules about
  moves and borrowing that we already covered.
  A few cases in point:
  - Just as everywhere else in the language, if
    a closure would `move` a value of a
    *copyable* type, like `i32`, it copies the
    value instead.
  - Values of *noncopyable* types, like `Vec<City>`,
    really are *moved*. Rust would not let us access
    `cities` by name after creating the closure.

* Well, a closure is callable, but its not a `fn`.
  The closure `|city| city.monster_attack_risk > limit`
  has its own type that's not a `fn` type,
* In fact, every closure you write has its own type,
  because a closure may contain data: values either
  `borrowed` or `stolen` from enclosing scopes.
* This could be any number of variables, in any
  combination of types. So every closure has an
  `ad hoc` type created by the compiler, large
  enough to hold that data. *No two closures* have
  exactly *the same type*. But every closure implements
  an `Fn` *trait*; the closure in our example implements
  `Fn(&City) -> i64`.
* Since every closure has its own type, code that
  works with closures usually needs to be generic,
  like `count_selected_cities`. Its a little clunky
  to spell out the generic types each time, but to
  see the advantages of this design, just read on.

* Any closure that requires `mut` access to
  a value, but doesn't `drop` any values,
  is an `FnMut` closure.
* The three categories of Rust closures.
  - `Fn` is the family of closures and functions
    that you can call multiple times without
    restriction. This **highest** category also
    includes all `fn` functions.
  - `FnMut` is the family of closures that can be
    called multiple times if the
    closure itself is declared `mut`.
  - `FnOnce` is the family of closures that can
    be called **once**, if the caller
    owns the closure.
* Every `Fn` meets the requirements for `FnMut`, and
  every `FnMut` meets the requirements for `FnOnce`.
* Instead, `Fn()` is a *subtrait* of `FnMut()`,
  which is a *subtrait* of `FnOnce( )`.
* This makes `Fn` the most exclusive and most powerful
  category. `FnMut` and `FnOnce` are broader
  categories that include closures
  with usage restrictions.

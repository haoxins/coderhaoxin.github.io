## Machine learning and graphs: An introduction

* When you face new problems or tasks that you
  would like to solve with a computer program,
  the following questions can help you
  decide whether to use machine learning:
  - Is the specific task *too complex to be programmed*?
  - Does the task require any sort of
    *adaptivity throughout its life*?

* In *stream analytics*, in which it is necessary
  to process a stream of data to reveal short-term
  anomalies, storing data in the form
  of a graph could be useless.

* Even the *best learning algorithm* on the
  **wrong data** produces the **wrong results**.

* For complex problems, data often matters
  more than algorithms.
  - Increasing the amount of data available
    during the training phase improved the
    performance of all the learners.

* Data concerns can be summarized in four categories:
  - Insufficient quantity of data
  - Poor quality of data
  - Nonrepresentative data
  - Irrelevant features

* *Feature selection* and *feature extraction* represent
  two important tasks during the preparation of data.

* Data management constraints and requirements
  - Managing big data
  - Designing a flexible schema
  - Developing efficient access patterns

* Performance is a complex topic in machine learning
  because it can be related to multiple factors:
  - Predictive accuracy
  - Training performance
  - Prediction performance

* In this context, graphs could provide the proper
  storage mechanism for both source and model data,
  reducing the access time required to read data as
  well as offering multiple algorithmic techniques
  for improving the accuracy of the predictions.

* The model's structure is related directly to the
  specific algorithm or the algorithm class employed.

* In directed graphs, an edge $$ E_ij $$ can be
  traversed from $$ V_i $$ to $$ V_j $$ but not
  in the opposite direction; $$ V_i $$ is
  called the tail, or start node, and $$ V_j $$ is
  called the head, or end node.

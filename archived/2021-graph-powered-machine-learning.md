## Machine learning and graphs: An introduction

* When you face new problems or tasks that you
  would like to solve with a computer program,
  the following questions can help you
  decide whether to use machine learning:
  - Is the specific task *too complex to be programmed*?
  - Does the task require any sort of
    *adaptivity throughout its life*?

* In *stream analytics*, in which it is necessary
  to process a stream of data to reveal short-term
  anomalies, storing data in the form
  of a graph could be useless.

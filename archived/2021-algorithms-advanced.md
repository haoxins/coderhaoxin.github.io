## Introducing data structures

* An *abstract data type* (**ADT**) specifies the
  operations that can be performed on some data and
  the computational complexity of those operations.
  - No details are provided on how data is stored
    or how physical memory is used.
* A *data structure* (**DS**) is a concrete
  implementation of the specification
  provided by an **ADT**.
* A more formal definition would describe an **ADT** as
  a set of types, a designated type from that type set,
  a set of functions, and a set of axioms.
* In contrast, a *data structure*, which is a concrete
  representation of data, is described from
  the point of view of an implementer, not a user.

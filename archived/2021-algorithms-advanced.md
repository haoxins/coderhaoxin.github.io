* [Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.manning.com/books/advanced-algorithms-and-data-structures)

## Introducing data structures

* An *abstract data type* (**ADT**) specifies the
  operations that can be performed on some data and
  the computational complexity of those operations.
  - No details are provided on how data is stored
    or how physical memory is used.
* A *data structure* (**DS**) is a concrete
  implementation of the specification provided by an **ADT**.

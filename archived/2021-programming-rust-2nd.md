```
Assuming that you can avoid undefined behavior in C and C++
is like assuming you can win a game of chess
simply because you know the rules.

The Rust language makes you a simple promise:
if your program passes the compiler's checks,
it is free of undefined behavior.

Dangling pointers, double-frees,
and null pointer dereferences are all caught at compile time.
Array references are secured with a mix of
compile-time and run-time checks,
so there are no buffer overruns:
the Rust equivalent of our unfortunate C program
exits safely with an error message.

Further, Rust aims to be both safe and pleasant to use.
In order to make stronger guarantees about your program's behavior,
Rust imposes more restrictions on your code than C and C++ do,
and these restrictions take practice and experience to get used to.
But the language overall is flexible and expressive.
This is attested to by the breadth of code written in Rust
and the range of application areas to which it is being applied.

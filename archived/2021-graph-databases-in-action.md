* [Graph Databases in Action](https://book.douban.com/subject/34700758/)

```
Key-value        (Redis)
  Wide-column    (Cassandra, HBase)
    Document     (MongoDB)
      Relational (MySQL, Postgres)
        Graph    (Dgraph, CosmosDB)

Simple -> Complex
```

> Our first decision was to pick the type of database.
> We decided to use a **labeled property graph** database,
> instead of, for example, an **RDF store** or **triplestore** database.

> In the end, we decided to use the
> Apache **TinkerPop** version 3.4.x framework

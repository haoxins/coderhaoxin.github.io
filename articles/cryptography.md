- [Solana](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana)
  - Solana is a decentralized blockchain built to
    enable scalable, user-friendly apps for the world.
  - [Anchor](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor)
  - Anchor is a framework for Solana's Sealevel runtime
    providing several convenient developer tools
    for writing smart contracts.
- There are 8 key innovations that make the
  Solana network possible:
  - Proof of History (POH)
  - Tower BFT - a PoH-optimized version of PBFT;
  - Turbine - a block propagation protocol;
  - Gulf Stream - Mempool-less transaction forwarding protocol;
  - Sealevel - Parallel smart contracts runtime;
  - Pipelining - a Transaction Processing Unit
    for validation optimization;
  - Cloudbreak - Horizontally-Scaled Accounts Database;
  - Archivers - Distributed ledger store.

The 2022 Gödel Prize is awarded to the following papers:

Zvika Brakerski, Vinod Vaikuntanathan:
Efficient Fully Homomorphic Encryption from (Standard) LWE.
FOCS 2011: 97-106. SIAM Journal of Computing 43(2): 831-871 (2014)

Zvika Brakerski, Craig Gentry, Vinod Vaikuntanathan:
(Leveled) fully homomorphic encryption without bootstrapping.
ITCS 2012: 309-325. ACM Transactions on Computation Theory 6(3): 13:1-13:36 (2014)

The above papers made transformative contributions to cryptography
by constructing efficient fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes.

The above papers presented entirely new constructions of
fully homomorphic encryption whose security relied only on
the hardness of Regev's learning with errors (LWE) problem.
They have led to a new generation of practically efficient FHE.

Resource Description Framework (RDF):
RDFs sconsist of triples-subject, predicate, and object –
that denote relationships (predicates) between
two entities or nodes (subject and object).
This model facilitates the representation and
integration of data from disparate sources,
commonly used in knowledge bases.
